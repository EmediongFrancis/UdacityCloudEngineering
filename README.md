# Udacity Cloud Developer Nanodegree Program

## Cloud Foundations
- Learn the fundamentals of cloud computing while being introduced to <i>compute power, security, storage, networking, messaging, and management services in the cloud</i>.
At the end of this section, you will deploy a static website to AWS. First, you will create a S3 bucket, configure the bucket for website hosting, and secure it using IAM policies. Next, you will upload the website files to your bucket and speed up content delivery using AWS’s content distribution network service, CloudFront. Lastly, you will access your website in a browser using the unique S3 endpoint.

## Full Stack Apps on AWS
- Design and deploy scalable, extendable, and maintainable full stack applications using modern cloud architecture.
At the end of this section, you will deploy <i>Udagram</i>, your own fullstack instagram app on AWS. You will develop a cloud-based application for uploading, listing, and filtering images. You will use Node.js/Express, a popular Javascript framework for networked application development. You will implement a REST API to issue commands using HTTP, store data in Amazon Web Services Relational Data Service (RDS) and S3, extend the codebase with secure authentication signon features, and deploy to Amazon Web Services Elastic Beanstalk.

## Monolith to Microservices at Scale
- Learn best practices on how to develop and deploy <i>microservices, with a focus on different microservice architecture patterns, independent scaling, resiliency, securing microservices, and best practices for monitoring and logging</i>.
At the end of this section, you will <b>refactor monolith to microservices and deploy</b>. You will take an existing application named Udagram and refactor it into a microservice architecture with lean services. You will build out a CI/CD process that automatically builds and deploys Docker images to a Kubernetes cluster. The Kubernetes cluster will be configured to help solve common challenges related to scale and security.

## Develop and Deploy a Serverless App
- Learn both the theory of using serverless technologies with the practice of developing a complex serverless application and focuses on learning by doing. You will learn advanced serverless features such as <i>implementing WebSockets and stream processing</i>.
You will develop an Instagram-like serverless service for uploading, listing, and filtering images. You’ll build serverless REST APIs using API Gateway and AWS Lambda, a stack of serverless technologies on AWS. You will then store data in AWS DynamoDB and S3, secure your application with authentication, and deploy it to Amazon Web Services using Serverless framework.
